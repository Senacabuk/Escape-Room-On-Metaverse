It is a Horror Themed Escape game. There is VR Support.

It is expected to develop a 3D game that can run on Windows and MacOS operating systems. While developing the game, Unity platform was used, and it was developed as a cross platform (MacOS and Windows: 2021.3.21f1 Intel and Apple Silicon distribution). In-game animations are designed by components in Unity. Scripts are written in C# programming language. The designs were provided through programs such as Adobe, Mixamo, Fuse. In addition, ready-made objects, and assets from the Internet.


The game could not be loaded because it was too big, so I uploaded some scripts.
